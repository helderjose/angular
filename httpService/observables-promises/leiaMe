+++++ Observable vs Promises +++++
--- Observables ---
Observables are lazy, nothing happens until you subscribe to them.
retry(3), if the server fails, this observable will retry three times.

--- Promises ---
Promises are eager, so as soon as you create a promise, the code is executed.


--- Take aways ---
+ You can always convert observables to promises;
+ Prefer observables;
+ They allow reactive programming;
+ They provide a bunch of useful operators;
+ Observables are lazy (nothing happens until you subscribe to them).
